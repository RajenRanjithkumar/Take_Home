## Completed all the given Functional Requirements

- The app will accept a GitHub user's id as input and display the specified user's avatar and name.
- For each public repository owned by the user, the app displays the name and description in a scrollable list.
- When a repository item is clicked, a card pops up with additional information such as when it was last updated, how many stars it has, and how many times it has been forked.
- An additional function to detect the Internet has been implemented, so when a user goes offline the app shows a popup to refresh.

## Design
- Replicated the UI and behaviour of the app as mentioned with subtle changes in layout design and colours.
- Below are the app layout screenshots,
